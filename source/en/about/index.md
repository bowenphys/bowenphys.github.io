I am a PhD researcher at **Example University**, working on condensed matter physics with a focus on computational theory.

This website tracks my research journey with an emphasis on reproducibility:

- mathematical derivations and physical interpretations
- numerical workflows and implementation details
- paper reading notes and project retrospectives
