I am a PhD researcher at **Example University**, working on condensed matter physics with a focus on computational theory.

This site acts as a research console where theory, numerics, and reproducibility are tracked in one place.

Current focus:

- low-energy theory in topological and superconducting systems
- scalable numerical pipelines and benchmark protocols
- paper-to-code translation with explicit assumptions and error logs

Lab snapshot (fictional placeholder):

- Active Projects: `07`
- Weekly Compute Time: `186 GPU-hours`
- Reproducibility Score: `96.4%`
- Pipeline Status: `PASS`
