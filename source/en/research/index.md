This page summarizes my current and near-term research directions.

## Direction 1: Low-energy theory in topological and superconducting systems

- goal: connect model-level assumptions with measurable observables
- method: analytics + numerics + interpretation
- deliverables: derivation notes, minimal numerical examples, reproducible scripts

## Direction 2: Scalable computational workflow

- goal: make repetitive research steps reusable and reproducible
- method: parameterized scripts, versioned outputs, shared plotting templates
- deliverables: reusable tooling, stable data formats, traceable configs and versions

## Direction 3: Paper-to-code translation

- goal: convert key ideas in papers into executable minimal examples
- method: structured reading notes, controlled assumptions, explicit boundary checks
- deliverables: paper-to-code projects, validation cases, error source notes
